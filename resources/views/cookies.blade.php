                    are used. With these technologies, a website or application can store information on your browser or device and later read that information back. We explain more about each of these technologies and how they are used on this page.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4 class="sec_title">Why do we use these technologies?</h4>

                <h4 class="sec_title">Authentication:</h4>
                <p>These tools tell us when you are logged in, so we can show you the appropriate experience.</p>
                <p>For example, cookies, local storage and similar technologies tell us when you are logged in to <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. so we can show you relevant information when you visit our website. We also use this information to
                    understand how people use our platform and other apps and services.</p>

                <p class="sec_subtitle">FOR EXAMPLE:</p>
                <p>They help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you. Cookies also let us know when several people have logged in from the same computer.</p>

                <p>We may read a cookie so we can serve you ads that may be interesting to you on Yaad International or other websites. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who was served an ad on <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. later
                    visited the advertiser’s site. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie or another similar technology to determine whether we have served an ad and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them. We
                    may also work with a partner to serve you an ad on or off, <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. such as after you have visited the partner’s site or app and this may involve the use of cookies, local storage on your device or other
                    similar technologies.</p>
                <p>These help <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. provide a localized experience.</p>
                <p class="sec_subtitle">FOR EXAMPLE:</p>
                <p>We may store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so you will see the site in your preferred language.</p>
                <p>These provide functionality that helps us deliver products and services.</p>
                <p class="sec_subtitle">FOR EXAMPLE:</p>
                <p>Cookies help you log in by pre-filling the username field and help make chat a better experience by showing which of your friends are online. We may also use cookies and similar technologies to help us provide you and others with social
                    plug-ins and other customized content and experiences, such as making suggestions to you and others.</p>
                <p>We use these to provide you with the best experience possible.</p>
                <p class="sec_subtitle">FOR EXAMPLE:</p>
                <p>We may use a cookie to help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly
                    <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. loads for different people. Sometimes we may store information on your browser or device.</p>
                <p>These are used to understand, improve, and research products and services, including when you access <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. or other websites and apps from a computer or mobile device.</p>
                <p class="sec_subtitle">FOR EXAMPLE:</p>
                <p>We may use cookies to understand how you are using social plug-ins to improve them. We and our partners may use these technologies and the information we receive to improve and understand how you use websites, apps, products, services
                    and ads. We may share information about this analysis with our partners.</p>
                <p>The specific names of the cookies, pixels and other similar technologies that we use may change from time to time, but they generally will fall into the above categories.</p>
                <p>This will give you a good idea of the cookies we describe on this page.</p>
                <p><strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. may place cookies when you visit us or a partner using a browser or device that permits the placement of cookies. Your browser or device may allow you to block these technologies, but you may not

                    or use them, including information about you and your device or browser. They may do this using cookies, pixels, or other similar technologies. To learn more about the information they collect or receive, review their privacy policies.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4 class="sec_title">How do we use cookies for our security purposes?</h4>
                <p>We use tools like cookies to help keep <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. safe, secure and easy to use. Cookies support or enable security features. For example, if someone logs into your account from a browser you have never used
                    before, we will block them and ask for more information. They also help us implement login notifications, so you can be alerted when your account is accessed and disable any active <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. sessions.
                </p>
                <p>Besides helping to keep unauthorized people from logging into your account, we also use cookies to help make sure the people or machines that access <strong>Yaad International
                    Ltd</strong>. don’t violate our policies. For example, certain information on
                    <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. is public and therefore can be accessed by anyone on the internet. These cookies help us understanding the volume and frequency of requests so we can detect and stop people or machines from
                    “scraping” information from our site.</p>
                <p>We also use these tools to make <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. easier to use, like when you mistype one character of your username or password. If you have already logged into Yaad International website from the same browser,
                    we will give you easier options to correct your typo since we know you have successfully logged into
                    <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. before.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4 class="sec_title">How does <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>.use cookies and local storage and similar technologies when user uses a mobile device:</h4>
                <p>Many mobile devices act just like computers, such as smart phones that support full-featured browsers. For those devices, <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. and our partners use cookies and similar technologies in a way that is similar
                    to when you are accessing the web from a computer.</p>
                <p>When you install our app or when <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong> we may obtain or receive information about your use of our app, your device or other apps. We use that information to understand and improve products, services, suggestions
                    and ads for you and others. As on the web, we may use these technologies to store an identifier or other information on your device. This helps us, for example, understand, optimize and deliver services or advertising from <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>.
                    or our partners. We may also work with our partners to receive information about the websites and apps you are using so we can understand, customize and improve our products and services and those of our partners. For example, if we
                    learn that you are already using an app, when you click on a link in News Feed from that app, we can send you directly to that app. If you don’t have the app, we would instead send you to the app store so you could download the app.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4 class="sec_title">How does <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong> use cookies if I don't have an account or have logged out of my account?</h4>
                <p>Identify and disable the accounts of spammers.</p>
                <p>Recover your account if you ever lose access to it.</p>
                <p>Provide extra security features like login notifications and login approvals.</p>
                <p>Prevent people who are underage from signing up with a false birth date.</p>
                <p>Enable us to deliver, evaluate and understand the ads we serve.</p>
                <p>Identify public computers so that we can discourage people from using keep me logged in and putting their account at risk.</p>
                <p>We may also use anonymized or aggregated information to improve our products.</p>
                <p>We also set cookies if you don’t have an account but have visited <strong>Yaad
                    International Ltd</strong>. to help protect us and the people who use it from malicious activity. For example, these cookies help us detect and prevent denial-of-service attacks and the mass creation of fake accounts.</p>
                <p>If you have cookies on your browser or device, we read that cookie when you visit a site with a social plugin. Pixel tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage that allow websites to do
                    things like read and place cookies. The resulting connection can include information such as the person’s IP address, the time the person viewed the pixel and the type of browser being used.</p>
                <p>We use pixels on and off <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. like when you visit our site or one of our partners. Pixels allow us to read any existing cookies or also place a new cookie on your browser or device. We use pixel tags
                    to customize your experience and learn about how people use products and services. For example, we can use pixel tags to see that a person using a certain browser was served an ad on and also bought a product from that advertiser.
                    This helps us show advertisers that the ads they run on
                    <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. are effective.</p>
                <p>We also may use pixels to help serve you an ad on or off for Yaad International Ltd. For example, a partner may use a pixel to tell us when you have visited their site so that we can later serve you an ad-on. We also use pixels to know
                    when you have seen or interacted with <strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>. content, like when you read an email notification, we have sent you so that we can avoid showing the same notification when you visit the website or app,
                    or to otherwise measure, understand, and improve our services.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4 class="sec_title"><strong>Yaad International Ltd</strong>: How we use storage technology ?</h4>
                <p>Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or app to store and retrieve data on a person’s computer, mobile phone or other device. Some examples include device or HTML5 local storage and caching. Most web browsers
                    offer settings for you to control whether or not to allow local storage.</p>
                <p>We use local storage to understand and improve how our products and services perform and to enable certain features. For example, we may store certain parts of the <strong>Yaad
                    International Ltd</strong>. website on your device so that those pages load faster the next time you visit them. Local storage also allows us to provide certain services to someone who doesn’t have access to the internet.
                    We may also use local storage to help us understand how you use websites, apps, computers or mobile devices. For example, we may use local storage on your device in connection with things like apps, where we cannot use cookies.
